* **support writing canteen feeds**: :ref:`feed` makes it very easy to generate a valid `OpenMensa Feed V2`_
* **python wrapper for OpenMensa data**: Access data (canteens, meals) transparent from OpenMensa_. **(in development)**

More information about OpenMensa and all possibilities for developers can be found in the `OpenMensa Documentation`_.
